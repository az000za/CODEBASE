# CODEBASE
codebase that makes attempt to enforce global name space debates

give it a goal whether it be an
-interface
or a
-prompt

the codebase will produce 
the algo paths needed to
achieve goal. the codebase is prepopulated
by the ai's contextual reference.
this will allow the ais
minimal prompts limits
be limitless in a sense as all the prompt
has to produce is the end goal interface
and the relational object algo path builder
will complete the coding as most of coding
is predictable through type => type strutcure
mapping.
